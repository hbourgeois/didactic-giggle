Background:
What is Citizens United?
“Citizens United” is shorthand for a landmark 2010 Supreme Court case – Citizens United v. FEC – that changed the face of campaign finance and money in politics in the United States.

Citizens United overturned certain long-standing restrictions on political fundraising and spending – transforming the entire political landscape of the country.

Most notably, Citizens United granted corporations, nonprofits, and unions unlimited political spending power.

Overview:
This project seeks to visualize the changes in campaign contributions by Political Action Committees (PAC's) and lobbying groups in 2009, 2014, and 2024.

Lobbyist bundled contributions file description
The Federal Election Campaign Act and Commission regulations require special reporting of certain contributions that are collected or “bundled” by:
- Lobbyists/registrants
- Political action committees (PACs) that are established or controlled by lobbyists/registrants, on behalf of authorized committees of federal candidates, political party committees, and leadership PACs
- Campaign committees, leadership PAC and political party committees must disclose information about these lobbyist/registrants and lobbyist/registrant PACs when they receive two or more bundled contributions that aggregate in excess of $18,200 (for 2018) during a particular covered period. The threshold amount is indexed annually and updated amounts are typically announced early in each calendar year.
- The file shows the total of contributions received during the quarter, month, or other time period specifically covered by this report. It shows the bundler’s name, address, aggregate amount of contributions bundled during the covered period, and refunds of bundled contributions for each lobbyist/registrant or lobbyist/registrant PAC that forwards, or is credited with raising more than $18,200 during the covered period.

Possible duplicated activity
The reports in this file disclose the total amount of bundled contributions received in each covered period. Reports filed in July and January may include activity from two covered periods:

The committee's regular quarterly or monthly reporting period, the pre-election covered period, or the post-election covered period

The semi-annual covered period
